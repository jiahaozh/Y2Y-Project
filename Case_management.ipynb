      "0 EVA told me she is working with case managers at Youth on Fire to find SRO (single-room occupancy) housing. She expressed specific interest in finding programs targeted at homeless youth and LGBTQ youth. She also mentioned interest in HomeStart, and getting help paying for housing. She did not seem interested in pursuing other case management goals outside of housing.\n",
      "1 Tito talked to me about how he has been homeless on the streets of Boston for almost the last 6 years. He mentioned struggling with substance abuse and briefly being in rehab.\n",

      "3 SOPHIE K filled out a LAMDA referral form for T.Y.'s Mass ID request. The referral form, T.Y.'s Mass ID form, and T.Y's verification of homelessness are all in the LAMDA folder of the filing cabinet in the CM room. Someone from LAMDA is coming tomorrow to work with T.Y.\n",
      "4 JACK has a strong background in philosophy and sociology because of research he has done independently and with mentors in the past. Note he would prefer to not go into the details about this research. JACK expressed interest in perhaps working as a RA for a professor (but maybe not at BU as he has had bad experiences with mentors there). JACK currently works at Whole Foods but his job may not be entire secured. JACK has recently come out of a relationship with an older woman who is emotionally abusive and controlling. JACK also suffered a severe health scare from OD on cough syrup, something he has abused since high school, but JACK does not feel that he needs rehab. JACK is looking into therapy through YOUTH ON FIRE. JACK is already on multiple housing lists and has identification and healthcare. JACK would like to explore more job options and save money to possibly leave Cambridge. JACK also expressed interest in going back to school - he completed some coursework at community college but did not complete the degree.\n",
      "5 TITO discussed his current struggle with drug use and his unsuccessful recent attempt at rehab. He feels that being on the streets makes it harder for him to stay clean, but thinks he'll do better now that he's staying here.\n",
      "6 JOHN C seems to be connecting well, and said he is enjoying his stay in the space. He is going through the loss (possibly temporary loss) of a job after kicking pneumonia. He also spoke of a recent \"bad\" experience with Robotussin. He says he is a hard worker and soon as he gets his strength back seems to want to get back to work.\n",
      "7 JACK indicated that he's used Youth on Fire and Bridge in the past. He filled out a two way information release allowing Y2Y to collaborate with both organizations on his case.\n"

DTA supervisor said that there is no written file saying that EMILY?s mom is unstable to be around her. But EMILY said that she has proof of past instances where it has gotten to the point where they were lucky that legal action wasn?t taken. EMILY?s mom was in a fist fight with EMILY before in front of her 8 year old little brother. She was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and depression. At the time had an abusive boyfriend and death of her father and grandmother. Did not go to the hospital and did not get the police involved. The mom?s neighbor heard them banging on the wall. EMILY has a mental health history. Went into DTA knowing she had a mental health history - they said that this would have nothing to do with her housing. EMILY?s mom doesn?t like the male guest. EMILY?s mom has a legal right to take her on and off of her lease. EMILY?s mom is diagnosed with PTSD because she has been in abusive relationships before and she has had to be a single mom before. EMILY?s mom receives therapy every Wednesday and takes medication. She has dyslexia and ADD (all the mom). She refuses to tell DTA that because she wants her and the future baby to live with her. JUSTIN?s mental health isn?t the best either but it?s stable. He?s controlling his autism and schizophrenia. EMILY?s mom mentioned it to the DTA.

He was moved into group homes, and eventually into a foster family when he was 10. He has an young sister, adopted from China, and a younger brother, adopted from the Philippines, in addition to 5 older siblings. He says he was kicked out of his home when he was 16 for doing things that high schoolers do, and wishes that he could live at home, somewhat resentful of his parents\\' \"tough love\" philosophy. He isn\\'t optimistic about starting counseling with someone at Bridge (every week on Mondays), because he hasn\\'t been able to connect with therapists in the past, but seemed interested when MINNIE mentioned that JOEL from Eliot comes in on Tuesdays.

Cindy Green - health and wellness check lady at the DTA. The lady said that she wasn?t in charge of the process but went to her supervisor. Put her trust in this caseworker because she was very sweet. DTA let EMILY down back to square one. Trouble with her mom and understands that the help that her mom offers isn?t good for her mental health and vice versa. JUSTIN found out his father has 6 months to live. DTA supervisor said that there is no written file saying that EMILY?s mom is unstable to be around her. But EMILY said that she has proof of past instances where it has gotten to the point where they were lucky that legal action wasn?t taken. EMILY?s mom was in a fist fight with EMILY before in front of her 8 year old little brother. She was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and depression. At the time had an abusive boyfriend and death of her father and grandmother. Did not go to the hospital and did not get the police involved. The mom?s neighbor heard them banging on the wall. EMILY has a mental health history. Went into DTA knowing she had a mental health history - they said that this would have nothing to do with her housing. EMILY?s mom doesn?t like the male guest. EMILY?s mom has a legal right to take her on and off of her lease. EMILY?s mom is diagnosed with PTSD because she has been in abusive relationships before and she has had to be a single mom before. EMILY?s mom receives therapy every Wednesday and takes medication. She has dyslexia and ADD (all the mom). She refuses to tell DTA that because she wants her and the future baby to live with her. JUSTIN?s mental health isn?t the best either but it?s stable. He?s controlling his autism and schizophrenia. EMILY?s mom mentioned it to the DTA. EMILY really needs housing and can?t go back to her mom?s. Would like to if they could stop fighting but doesn?t want to put her brother through that. It bothered EMILY that her brother saw them fighting. He cries all the time and says that he misses EMILY. Mom blames it on EMILY. EMILY called her sister today wondering if she could get some support. Her sister is the kind of person that will give you the hard truth and called EMILY childish. JUSTIN doesn?t seem to approve of EMILY?s sister. Sister lives in Braintree with her mother-in-law. EMILY doesn?t talk to her family. EMILY doesn't really know what's in her future, but she is working with case managers at Bridge to try and make a plan.

Cindy Green - health and wellness check lady at the DTA. The lady said that she wasn?t in charge of the process but went to her supervisor. Put her trust in this caseworker because she was very sweet. DTA let EMILY down back to square one. Trouble with her mom and understands that the help that her mom offers isn?t good for her mental health and vice versa. JUSTIN found out his father has 6 months to live. DTA supervisor said that there is no written file saying that EMILY?s mom is unstable to be around her. But EMILY said that she has proof of past instances where it has gotten to the point where they were lucky that legal action wasn?t taken. EMILY?s mom was in a fist fight with EMILY before in front of her 8 year old little brother. She was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and depression. At the time had an abusive boyfriend and death of her father and grandmother. Did not go to the hospital and did not get the police involved. The mom?s neighbor heard them banging on the wall. EMILY has a mental health history. Went into DTA knowing she had a mental health history - they said that this would have nothing to do with her housing. EMILY?s mom doesn?t like the male guest. EMILY?s mom has a legal right to take her on and off of her lease. EMILY?s mom is diagnosed with PTSD because she has been in abusive relationships before and she has had to be a single mom before. EMILY?s mom receives therapy every Wednesday and takes medication. She has dyslexia and ADD (all the mom). She refuses to tell DTA that because she wants her and the future baby to live with her.
