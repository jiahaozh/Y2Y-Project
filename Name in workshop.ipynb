      "CMs were roxtars today!! Legit this is the truthEliot and Roxbury Youth Works were both in the space tonight and were super great, just hanging out with guests! CHARLIE completed first half of intake with DERON but could not complete the CM half. Can you note that it should be completed in the future next time he is in? He is entering the 30-day lottery tmrw morning. DERON would like help from CMs doing mock job interviews.RYAN & JULIO & EVA may be interested in checking in with doctor tomorrow.Doctor Wendy was in and she saw 4 people! She was really pleased that she was useful and the people that saw her liked her :)TYLER G was asleep, so his action item wasn't addressed. RYAN M also has many action items needing follow up.[1] CMs were so, so lovely. They were all in at different intervals, and tackled many an intake/long conversation/CM action plan work tonight. [2] DR. GOLDMAN came in, saw 4 people, was wonderful. She won't be in next week. Also, an addiction specialist will start coming in apparently. [3] CM productivity and best utilizing 9pmLegal team was here and worked with some guests!Casually just check in on GABE if he got his low-income housing apps yet because he had some questions, but FRANCES will check in on Thursday for sure!We got a call from SARAH SELKOVITS at a human service agency named Bay Cove Human Services. Her agency serves people with mental health, brain injury, and substance abuse problems. She wanted to come to the space on Friday morning to drop off flyers for an upcoming open house.

[2] Which days are CMs coming in irregularly (?) [3] When he can see STEPHA next, to help out with some housing things?MAX left an envelope (housing application) for STEPHA (CM). The envelope is in the first drawer of the filing cabinet in the team room.Many copies of the SAS packets and referral forms were printed out, and guests were notified that the CMs for the Somerville Homeless Coalition are coming into the space on Thursday from 8-10 pm. KRIS suggested that rather than coming into the main space that the Somerville Homeless Coalition w CM workshop be held in either the gallery or parlor room where SPPC would normally be held, so guests who might not have a 30-day bed or E-bed with us currently can still apply for permanent housing. RITA thinks this is a good idea, what do you think? Especially since SPPC is being cancelled this week because we are understaffed?the completed and yet to be done forms for the Somerville things are in the CM filing cabinet @LEOUL can you confirm this?[1] When officers came to the door with TYLSER S [see notes below for more information!], it was indicated that they honestly did not know our police cot system very well. Just wanted to flag it for you, because we're now wondering about best ways to communicate this to CPD/make sure they know it exist [and how it works]. [2] SARABETH gave us a resource sheet for furniture! ZEYNEP has this and will take a picture/send it over! The physical copy lives in the CM filing cabinet.Stored the three completed forms for SAS Referrals in the first drawer of the CM filing cabinet!

More to come in addendum!JUSTIN really wants to lead a cooking workshop. Called out ZEYNEP for being FAKE!NoneCORBIN is interested in the Gender Identity Opera Workshop. Is CPD referral also age verification or nah? @ ARAMBI: BOB really wants to be more involved in the space and has lots of time/contacts. Please reach out (email or calling is good) to follow up on some of his ideas -Please reach out to BREAKFAST BOB about getting a dental clinic in the space! He's got contacts at Harvard Dental -BREAKFAST BOB is also really interested in leading a cooking workshop.Guest MAX spoke with PRIYANKA and said he is really stressed out because he is not able to get housing and SARABETH will be having her second child soon. MAX really wants to work with CMs to 1) get another job because his current one only allows him to work 12-16 hours/week and 2) work on housing applications. MAX is afraid he will not be able to work with CMs because his 30-day bed will be up. PRIYANKA said that if MAX would like he can schedule meetings with CMs outside of the space, as well. Please reach out to MAX to schedule CM meetings when possible. RYAN M wants to know how to another statement/documentation from a doctor saying he has struggled with addiction and has gotten treatment and is still in active recovery. This is for the SAS program that came in on Thursday last week. Please reach out to him ASAP.Connect ENRIQUE, RYAN, KRIS, JEFF, JOSH, and ROMANE to doctor in order to complete SAS form.

She already has a job working at the MGH but really needs help with housing. DORELL?s ID is in his CM file @ARAMBI: Just a friendly reminder to check in with BOB. He's got a lot of great things to offer the space :) TERRACE JONES (sp?) called to see about getting a bed here during the day and left some voicemails that I listened to overnight. They are currently staying at Pine Street but would like to get a bed here. They didn't leave a phone number and I am trying to see if we can see the number they called from, but do we have any options in terms of outreach?Doctor came<3 <3there's definitely some tensions in the space right now. We have been told that they have lead to threats made outside the space. Just something to be aware of. TMRW: -finish housing apps for Romane and Max/Sarabeth -If Jada is in she could also work on housing apps -Enrique would also like to work on housing. (Section 8 would be a great place to start-- he is currently on an ebed not a 30 day)COURTNEY is gr9Check in with MAX about a potential ukulele workshop. Schedule KJ?s eye appt. We also had ample issues with police officers tonight that would be worth checking in about: -EVA and OMARIE called police to make referrals. They got a regular patrol cop, not an outreach cop, and he was very confrontational about making the referral. He was unfamiliar with the process, but very verbally aggressive toward EVA especially. He really aggressively let them know that their situation wasn?t an emergency and that he had more important things to do. Please clarify with not just the outreach cops the referral process. EVA called in to make a complaint and in another incident in which the police came back to the space, the same officer who had originally made this referral came to apologize, but still, his original language was really aggressive. -Unclear what happened between YW JALEN and officers, but there also seemed to be a lot of tension there. The police officer spoke in a way that JALEN felt was very disrespectful and they had a conversation about this; after the incident w KAT, JAMES, etc. was calmed down and we brought everyone up he went back up to have another conversation with the officer. RYAN checked in w JALEN about this, who said that all was good between them -See overall notes for issues with later incidents -Overall, interactions with police tonight didn't feel that productive and ultimately felt like they actually helped escalate a few situations. Things were already well out of control, but they being there didn't really help.JADA and others suggest more thorough intake. She feels that any prohibited items (ie marijuana) is being kept on people's person, and items like that can really throw off other guests, especially ones holding onto their sobriety. A few guests talked about a desire for YW to be more professional, less like friends, although they know the YW care about our guests very much. Also expressed a desire for more thorough security intake, including when guests go outside for a few minutes and come back down.SARABETH wanted to talk to a legal volunteer. She got to talk to amazing HLAB vol MEETHA today!-CHEYENNE and JOEL were both in and amazing as usual!! (Eliot and Roxbury Youth). -@ARAMBI: New guest CHRISTIAN T would like to teach a workshop on computers/AI! Sounds super cool!

New BRIDGE guest AARON is really into fitness (doing pushups in the space!) and would be super excited about running an exercise workshop We also had no CMs tonight, but it would be really awesome if a few could come in later this week, just to help out with exit surveys/intake/etc <3 JOHN C lost his ID card, and would like to be connected to services to get a new one.Does ROMAINE have an extension for his long-term bed due to his SAS application? Impt just because his last night is tomorrow. We really would love CMs :?( lots of guests asking if possible Dr. Goldman was amazing and talked to GABE and KRIS!I tried to call RYAN M and inform him to call someone at SAS to ensure he keeps his spot in the housing program, but no one picked up.

She really wants ARAMBI to respond to her emails about monthly service provider meetings.see note re TYLERWe only had two CMs in and one was here for a half shift.

Or a facility that has their beds open during the day? He asks because of his work schedule he feels that he is dealing with a lot of things to juggle in addition to having enough sleep. Also, he mentioned considering applying to college, which I think would be a good idea to ask CMs if they could reach out to him about it? This is more of a general question. Can CMs offer help with college application, not only logistical but also on how to write an essay, or how the application works (aka CommonApp logistics)[1] JANELLE was wondering if her primary CM could email her a verification of the dates she has been staying with us at janelleperez11599@gmail.comnoneADRIAN seems like he would like some advice on long-term goals (e.g. going into the military); said he hadn't talked to any Pathways personnel, so if anyone would like to check in on this, feel free!MIKEY needs an appointment with LAMBDA to finish his passport application.
