# Y2Y-Project

## Description:
Y2Y Harvard Square, a student-run overnight shelter, employs a youth-youth model to provide a safe and affirming environment for young adults experiencing homelessness. The shelter is running since December 2015 and has sheltered hundreds of homeless youths aging between 18 to 24. Y2Y hopes to have a understanding of the factors that can lead to better outcomes or hinder their progress. To help the organization to do so, basically we addressed three specific questions as follows: 

## Problems:
### Weather analysis: 
Does the weather affect who seeks shelter at Y2Y ("who is entering our lottery?"). Testing the hypothesis that young adults who are ready to work on their pathway out of homelessness enter the lottery regardless of the weather, whereas young adults who are not ready to work on their pathway out of homelessness seek shelter mostly during poor weather conditions.

### Success model: 
Are certain guests (who possess a set of characteristics, e.g. chronic homelessness status, chronic disability status, race, age) more likely to succeed at Y2Y (get housing, get a job)? 

### Case management: 
How does engagement with Y2Y case management (working with case managers, participation in workshops) affect outcomes? Does participation in, eg. employment-related workshops and job-related conversations with case managers usually lead to better employment outcomes?

### Warning analysis: 
Whenever a guest breaks a certain rule of the shelter, they receive a warning. We are trying to analyze whether the number of warnings given to a guest is related with the success rate i.e. Is the warning rate proportional to the success rate?

## Jupyter notebook description:

### WeatherData.ipynb: Web scraped Wether Data.
### Score_Calculation.ipynb: Calculated Vulnerability Score of each person. 
### Case_management.ipynb: Obtained outcome(Job and Housing) of each person.
### Name in workshop.ipynb:Obtained name lists. Obtained Work Participation, Action Participation and warning of each person.
### and established the entire model.
